# Bookmarklets
A list of Bookmarklets that work in safari.
Or rather, a list of bookmarklets I have found (stolen) while searching the web (other peoples repositories). I have tested them all thoroughly (checked them one on about:blank before reloading the page) and found they all work.
They are all js. Feel free to suggest a bookmarklet, ill probably add it if it works.


star if you like it! Please?


credits/where is got the bookmarklets: the topic "bookmarklets" or "bookmarklet" on GitHub. (I cant remember where I got all of them :P)
